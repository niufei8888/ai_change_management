## Avoiding Common Mistakes

Using our multimodal agent means you’re working with something powerful.

But power comes with a predictable set of failure modes.

The good news is:
Most frustrating outcomes come from a small list of common mistakes.

This article covers the biggest ones across:

- task planning
- working with the agent
- uploading + analyzing assets
- image generation
- video generation
- consistency
- iteration and batching

And for every mistake, you’ll see:

- what *not* to do
- why it breaks
- what to do instead (with copy/paste templates)

#### Don’t start generating before you define the goal

**❌ What not to do**

`Make something cinematic.`

Or:

`Generate a trailer.`

**Why it fails**

The agent has no idea what “good” means to you.
So it guesses — and you get random outputs.

**✅ Do this instead**

Start with a clear end result.

**Prompt template**

`I want to end up with:
[describe the final deliverable]
This is for:
[where it will be used]
The most important qualities are:
[list qualities]
Before generating anything, summarize your understanding and ask any questions you need.`

#### Don’t treat the agent like a vending machine

**❌ What not to do**

`Give me 10 options.`

With no context, no references, no constraints.

**Why it fails**

You’ll get 10 *different* interpretations of your vague idea — not 10 useful options.

**✅ Do this instead**

Treat it like a teammate you’re briefing.

**Prompt template**

`You are my [creative assistant]
Before creating anything:]
- ask questions if unclear
- confirm the goal
- suggest the best approach
Then generate [10] options that are meaningfully different.`

#### Don’t ask for “perfect” on the first try

**❌ What not to do**

`Make it perfect.
Make it final.`

**Why it fails**

It sets unrealistic expectations and encourages you to restart instead of refine.

**✅ Do this instead**

Ask for exploration first, refinement second.

**Prompt template**

`Let’s start with exploration.
Generate [10] options that explore different directions.
Then we will pick 1 or more and refine.`

#### Don’t generate one output at a time

**❌ What not to do**

Generate one image → stare at it → feel disappointed → restart.

**Why it fails**

One output is basically a coin flip.
It also gives you no comparison.

**✅ Do this instead**

Generate small batches.

**Prompt template**

`Generate [10] options.
Make them meaningfully different.
Label them clearly so I can see how you made them and compare.`

#### Don’t give feedback like “I don’t like it”

**❌ What not to do**

`No.
Not good.
Try again.`

**Why it fails**

The agent has no actionable direction.
So it guesses again.

**✅ Do this instead**

Use focused feedback.

**Prompt template**

`I like:
[what works]
I don’t like:
[what doesn’t]
Please change:
[specific adjustment]
Then show me [2] improved versions.`

### Asset Upload + File Analysis Mistakes

#### Don’t upload a file and say “do something with this”

**❌ What not to do**

Upload a PDF and ask:

`What do you think?`

**Why it fails**

You’ll get generic summaries or random guesses about what you want.

**✅ Do this instead**

Select the file you’ve uploaded, then tell the agent what kind of work you want done.

**Prompt template**

`Analyze this file.
First:
- summarize what it contains
- extract the key points
Then:
- ask me what output I want to create from it`

#### Don’t ask the agent to invent missing info from a file

**❌ What not to do**

“Fill in the missing parts.”

**Why it fails**

This is how you get hallucinated details.

**✅ Do this instead**

Make the file the source of truth.

**Prompt template**

`Use this file as the source of truth.
If something is not stated:
- do not invent it
- ask me a question instead`

#### Don’t skip the “extract constraints” step

**❌ What not to do**

Upload brand guidelines → jump straight to generation.

**Why it fails**

Brand work is mostly constraints.
If you don’t extract them, outputs may drift.

**✅ Do this instead**

Extract rules first.

**Prompt template**

`From this file, extract:
- must-have rules
- must-not-do rules
- tone/style rules
- visual rules
Then rewrite them as a short checklist we can reuse in prompts.`

### Image Generation Mistakes

#### Don’t change everything at once when iterating

**❌ What not to do**

“Make it brighter, different style, new camera, new character, new setting.”

**Why it fails**

You can’t tell what caused improvement or failure.

**✅ Do this instead**

Change one variable at a time.

**Prompt template**

`Keep everything the same except:
[one change]
Generate [3] variations.`

#### Don’t rely on “style words” alone

**❌ What not to do**

“Make it cinematic, high quality, detailed.”

**Why it fails**

Those words are vague and overused.
They don’t define a real look.

**✅ Do this instead**

Use visual references OR a style description.

**Prompt template**

`Use this style reference:
[select image(s) / shift+click assets]
Match:
- lighting
- color palette
- texture/material feel
- composition style
Do not copy the content.
Only match the aesthetic.`

#### Don’t ignore consistency until later

**❌ What not to do**

Generate 20 images and only then realize that the character keeps changing.

**Why it fails**

Consistency is easiest to lock early.

**✅ Do this instead**

Create a reference block first.

**Prompt template**

`Before generating more images:
Describe this character/object in detail.
Then list:
- what must stay consistent
- what can vary
We will reuse this in every prompt.`

### Video Generation Mistakes

#### Don’t try to generate a full 60–90s video in one go

**❌ What not to do**

`Generate a 1:30 cinematic trailer.`

**Why it fails**

Long videos require structure.
One-shot generation creates drift and chaos.

**✅ Do this instead**

Break it into moments.

**Prompt template**

`Break this video into [4-6] moments.
For each moment:
- what we see
- what we feel
- what must stay consistent
Then we will generate one moment at a time.`

#### Don’t assume video must start from text

**❌ What not to do**

Only using T2V because it’s the default.

**Why it fails**

Text-only video is often less stable and requires more iteration.

**✅ Do this instead**

Choose a start strategy based on what you have.

**Prompt template**

`I want to create a video.
Here is what I have to start with:
- [text] (optional)
- [image] (optional)
- [video] (optional)
- [keyframes] (optional)
Recommend the best start strategy:
T2V, I2V, V2V, or Keyframes.
Explain why.`

#### Don’t skip keyframes when consistency matters

**❌ What not to do**

Try to generate multiple scenes without any anchors.

**Why it fails**

Multi-shot sequences drift in:

- style
- characters
- lighting
- environment

**✅ Do this instead**

Keyframe first.

**Prompt template**

`Before generating motion:
Create 1 keyframe per moment.
Each keyframe must:
- match the style references
- keep character consistency
- clearly communicate the story beat`

#### Don’t “fix video” by endlessly regenerating

**❌ What not to do**

Regenerate 20 times hoping it magically improves.

**Why it fails**

That’s gambling, not iteration.

**✅ Do this instead**

Diagnose and adjust.

**Prompt template**

`Analyze what is wrong with this video.
Classify issues into:
- motion issues
- camera issues
- style drift
- character drift
- pacing issues
Then propose [3] fixes in order of impact.`

### Planning + Workflow Mistakes

#### Don’t start with tools, start with structure

**❌ What not to do**

“Should I use [model name] or [model name]?”

**Why it fails**

Tool selection comes after you know what you’re making.

**✅ Do this instead**

Define the output first.

**Prompt template**

`My output goal is:
[deliverable]
Now recommend:
- a simple plan
- which tools/models to use at each step
- where to iterate`

#### Don’t try to do everything in one session

**❌ What not to do**

Trying to create:

- story
- visuals
- keyframes
- final video
- voiceover
- sound design

…all at once.

**Why it fails**

You lose clarity and quality.

**✅ Do this instead**

Work in layers.

**Prompt template**

`Let’s do this in layers:
1) structure
2) style
3) keyframes
4) shots
5) refinement
Start with layer 1 only.`

### Multi-Agent + Multi-Model Mistakes

#### Don’t assume the agent knows what you want without confirmation

**❌ What not to do**

`You know what I mean.`

**Why it fails**

The agent can’t read your taste unless you define it.

**✅ Do this instead**

Ask for a summary and confirmation.

**Prompt template**

`Before generating:
Summarize what you think I want.
Then ask:
- what should be locked
- what should be explored`

#### Don’t let the agent “choose everything” without telling it your priorities

**❌ What not to do**

`Pick the best model.`

**Why it fails**

“Best” depends on what you care about:

- realism
- style
- speed
- consistency
- motion quality

**✅ Do this instead**

State your priorities.

**Prompt template**

`When choosing tools/models, prioritize:
1) [e.g., consistency]
2) [e.g., cinematic lighting]
3) [e.g., speed]
Explain tradeoffs briefly.`

### The Biggest Mistake of All

#### Don’t restart when you should refine

**❌ What not to do**

Throw everything away because one thing is wrong.

**Why it fails**

You lose progress and you don’t learn what worked.

**✅ Do this instead**

Preserve what’s good and fix what isn’t.

**Prompt template**

`Keep everything that is working.
Only fix:
[the specific issue]
Show me [2] improved versions.`

### Final Reminder–The mindset that prevents 80% of mistakes

Most frustration comes from expecting AI to behave like a magic button.

A better expectation is:

- you are collaborating
- you are directing
- you are iterating
- you are building in layers

And the best part is:

Once you work this way, you get:

- more control
- more consistency
- faster results
- and way less randomness

## Luma Video Models Field Guide

*A comprehensive reference guide for video generation AI models available in Luma, their strengths, limitations, and practical application strategies.*

### Ray3.14 (Luma)

**Overview:** Luma's latest and fastest video model. This is your default workhorse for video generation. Native 1080p and HDR support make it the go-to for professional video work.

#### Strengths

- **DEFAULT recommended model** — fastest generation of the Luma lineup
- Native **1080p resolution** support (also 720p, 540p, Draft)
- **HDR output** with expanded dynamic range for dramatic lighting scenarios.
- **EXR export option** for professional color grading workflows (available in 540p and 720p)

**\*HDR** and **HDR+EXR** are available only for **text2video** and **image2video**; Modify and HDR/EXR is not supported

- Supports **start frame AND end frame keyframes** (precise interpolation between two images)
- **6 aspect ratios**: 9:16 (portrait), 3:4, 1:1 (square), 4:3, 16:9 (landscape), 21:9 (ultrawide)
- **Seamless loop support** for product showcases and repeating content
- **5s or 10s duration for** Text-to-video; image-to-video is **5s**; Modify supports up to **18s**; extensions can reach ~**30s**.
- Strong **cinematic quality** — filmic lighting, steady camera work, believable motion
- Excellent prompt adherence when following Luma's prompting best practices
- Excels in Modify V2V (video-to-video) transformations

#### Weaknesses

- **No character reference support** (must use Ray3 for that)
- **No native audio** — need separate audio tools
- **Prompt-sensitive**: certain words like "vibrant," "whimsical," "hyper-realistic" may degrade output quality (test)
- Can struggle with very complex multi-subject action scenes compared to Sora
- Requires understanding of Luma's specific prompting methodology for best results

#### Specialties

Cinematic footage, product videos, smooth keyframe interpolation, HDR content, professional workflows requiring EXR export, looping content, ultrawide cinematic sequences

#### Best Practices

**DO:**

- Use **mid-action verbs**: "running" not "begins to run"
- **“Positive only”** model. **Negative prompting is counterproductive.**
- Include **secondary consequences**: wind in hair, fabric movement, reflections, dust kicked up, water ripples
- Default to **cinematic style** unless otherwise specified
- With keyframes: describe only what **CHANGES**, don't redescribe static elements
- Keep prompts about 100 words long, action-focused, and **present tense**
- Describe **temporal movement** — what happens as the scene progresses
- Be specific about camera movement: "camera dollies forward," "slow pan right," "aerial descending shot"

**DON'T:**

- Avoid using: **"vibrant," "whimsical," "hyper-realistic"** – these tend to degrade quality
- Avoid vague descriptors like "beautiful," "amazing," "stunning"
- Don't use temporal phrases like "begins to" or "starts to"
- Don't over-describe static elements, focus on describing the elements that need to move

**Prompt Template**

`Create a video of [SUBJECT] [MID-ACTION VERB] in [SETTING], [SECONDARY MOTION/CONSEQUENCE], [CAMERA MOVEMENT if any], [LIGHTING/MOOD].`

**Examples**

- "A golden retriever running through a wheat field, ears flapping in the wind, dust particles catching golden hour sunlight, camera tracking alongside."
- "Espresso pouring into a white ceramic cup, steam rising, liquid swirling, macro close-up, warm morning light."
- "Dancer spinning on a rooftop at sunset, dress billowing outward, hair flowing, city lights glowing in background, camera orbiting slowly."

#### Tips & Gotchas

- **Start here for 90% of video work** — it's fast, high-quality, and versatile
- Use **720p for iteration**, 1080p for finals (saves time and credits)
- **Loop mode** is excellent for product showcase content that needs to repeat seamlessly
- **HDR mode** is outstanding for dramatic lighting scenarios: sunsets, neon signs, fire, and stage lighting
- The **EXR export** is a game-changer for professional color grading pipelines
- **21:9 ultrawide** is perfect for cinematic letterbox aesthetic

### Ray3 (Luma)

#### Overview

Luma's character-reference-capable model. Use when you need a specific character maintained across shots without needing perfect keyframes of that character.

#### Strengths

- **CHARACTER REFERENCE support** – upload a character reference image to maintain character identity across your video generations, supported in T2V, I2V, V2V and Reference Mode.
- Same keyframe support as Ray3.14 – start frame, end frame (5s frame/120th frame)
- **6 aspect ratios** (9:16, 3:4, 1:1, 4:3, 16:9, 21:9)
- **5s or 10s duration**
- **Seamless loop support**
- **HDR and EXR support**
- Cinematic quality with more expressive and intense movement
- **Enhanced prompt mode** available for better adherence

#### Weaknesses

- **Slower than Ray3.14** — noticeably longer generation times
- **Native 1080p**
- No native audio
- Same prompt sensitivity as Ray3.14 (avoid "vibrant," "whimsical," etc.)

#### Specialties

Character-consistent multi-shot sequences, narrative projects, storyboards with recurring characters, and any work requiring the same character across multiple video generation modes.

#### Best Practices

**Same rules as Ray3.14** (mid-action verbs, secondary consequences, no banned words)

**Character Reference Specific:**

- When using character reference, the **prompt should describe the scene/action**, and the reference image handles identity
- You don’t have to re-describe the character's physical appearance if using a reference — let the reference image do that work
- With keyframes AND character reference: describe action/setting changes, not character features

**Prompt Template**

`Create a video of [CHARACTER DESCRIPTION if no ref] [MID-ACTION VERB] in [SETTING], [SECONDARY MOTION], [CAMERA if any], [LIGHTING/MOOD].`

#### Prompt Examples

- With character ref: "Character walking through a foggy forest, leaves crunching underfoot, mist swirling around legs, low-angle tracking shot."
- Without ref: "Young woman in red jacket hiking up a mountain trail, backpack bouncing, hair tied back, breathing visible in cold air, golden hour side lighting."

#### Tips & Gotchas

- **Only reach for this when you specifically need character reference** — Ray 3.14 is faster and higher-res for everything else
- Ray is a “positive only” model. Negative prompting is counterproductive.
- Character reference works best with **clear, well-lit reference images** showing the character's face and defining features
- Can **combine character reference WITH keyframes** for maximum control over both identity and composition
- Great for **narrative sequences** where the same character appears in multiple locations/scenarios
- The enhanced prompt mode can help with complex scenes but increases generation time

### Veo 3 (Google)

#### Overview

Google's video model with native audio generation. Generates synchronized dialogue, sound effects, and ambient audio alongside video.

#### Strengths

- **NATIVE AUDIO generation** — dialogue, SFX, ambient sound, all synchronized with video
- Include dialogue in quotes for **automatic lip-sync**: e.g., 'A man says, "Hello world"
- Text-based "inpainting" for scene modifications.
- Uses reference images for character/background consistency.
- Significantly **SLOWER than Sora** for longer videos.
- **720p and 1080p resolution** (1080p only available for 16:9 aspect ratio)
- **4s, 6s, or 8s duration** options
- High adherence to professional camera, lens, and lighting terminology.
- Good for standalone videos that need integrated audio from the start
- Cinematic quality
- High temporal adherence means more physical realism.
- Long context window, it can handle long, detailed prompts

#### Weaknesses

- **Only 2 aspect ratios** (16:9, 9:16) — very limited framing options compared to Luma `models
- **No keyframe support** (no start/end frame control for precise visuals)
- **No character reference**
- **No loop support**
- Less cinematic quality than Ray models — visuals can feel "AI-ish" with occasional artifacts
- Poor for multi-video projects requiring visual consistency across shots
- **Audio quality can be hit-or-miss**; dialogue can sound robotic or uncanny
- 1080p locked to 16:9 only

#### Specialties

Audio-integrated videos, talking head content, ambient scene videos with natural sound, quick social content with sound, dialogue-driven shorts

#### Best Practices

**Audio Integration**

- Put dialogue in **quotes**: 'A woman says, "Welcome to our channel"'
- Describe sound effects explicitly: "thunder rumbling," "waves crashing," "footsteps echoing"
- Be specific about ambient sound: "busy coffee shop chatter," "forest birds chirping," "city traffic humming"

**Visual**

- Keep prompts **clean and concise** (1-2 sentences)
- Focus on what's visually happening AND what you want to hear
- Simple is better — complex scenes can degrade quality

**Prompt Template**

`[Cinematography] + [Subject] + [Action] + [Context] + [Style] + [Ambiance] + [Audio].`

#### Prompt Examples

- “Tracking shot following the explorer as she steps into the clearing and runs her hand over the intricate carvings on a crumbling stone wall. Emotion: Wonder and reverence."
- “Wide, high-angle crane shot, revealing the lone explorer standing small in the center of the vast, forgotten temple complex, half-swallowed by the jungle. SFX: A swelling, gentle orchestral score begins to play.”
- “Reverse shot of the explorer's freckled face, her expression filled with awe as she gazes upon ancient, moss-covered ruins in the background. SFX: The rustle of dense leaves, distant exotic bird calls.”

#### Tips & Gotchas

- **Best when you need audio baked in from the start** and don't want to sync separately
- For **higher visual quality** without audio, use Ray 3.14 + separate audio tools
- **1080p only works at 16:9** — portrait is locked to 720p (significant limitation)
- **Multi-shot consistency** — While each generation is independent, use **"First Frame"** anchoring or the **"Scene Extension"** tool to carry character details across shots.
- The **dialogue feature is powerful,** but the voice quality is inconsistent (can sound robotic).
- Good for quick social content where audio matters more than cinematic perfection

### Veo 3.1 (Google)

#### Overview

Updated version of Veo 3 with keyframe support. Same native audio capabilities with added visual control through start and end frame keyframes.

#### Strengths

- Everything Veo 3 has **PLUS keyframe support** (start frame and end frame)
- **Native audio generation** with dialogue, SFX, ambient sound
- **1080p and 720p** at **4s, 6s, or 8s** durations**.**
- **Optional 4K upscaling**—**specifically reconstructs textures and** skin pores rather than just stretching pixels.
- Can **bridge between two keyframe images with audio** — unique capability
- Better visual control than Veo 3 for specific compositional needs

#### Weaknesses

- Same **limited aspect ratios** as Veo 3 (16:9, 9:16 only)
- **Up to three (3) reference images.**
- **No loop support**—unofficial workflow possible
- **1080p available** for all durations—4s, 6s, 8s
- Same visual quality limitations as Veo 3 — less cinematic than Ray models
- Audio quality is still variable and can be uncanny
- Falls back to Veo 3 if generation fails

#### Specialties

Keyframe-guided videos with native audio, image-to-video with sound, scene transitions with audio, and bridging two specific visual moments with synchronized sound

#### Best Practices

**Same as Veo 3** — dialogue in quotes, describe sounds explicitly

**With Keyframes**

- Describe the **transition/action between frames** AND the audio you want
- Focus on the journey from start frame to end frame
- Don't redescribe static elements visible in the keyframes

**Prompt Template**

`[Cinematography] + [Subject] + [Action] + [Context] + [Style] + [Ambiance] + [Audio].`

#### Prompt Examples

- “Tracking shot following the explorer as she steps into the clearing and runs her hand over the intricate carvings on a crumbling stone wall. Emotion: Wonder and reverence."
- “Wide, high-angle crane shot, revealing the lone explorer standing small in the center of the vast, forgotten temple complex, half-swallowed by the jungle. SFX: A swelling, gentle orchestral score begins to play.”
- “Reverse shot of the explorer's freckled face, her expression filled with awe as she gazes upon ancient, moss-covered ruins in the background. SFX: The rustle of dense leaves, distant exotic bird calls.”

#### Tips & Gotchas

- Use this **over Veo 3 when you have keyframe images** and need audio
- **U**se **Veo 3.1 Fast** model ( ~70% cheaper and 2x faster) for testing. Once locked, re-run the same seed and prompt on **Standard** with **“4k”** enabled for the final render.
- The **keyframe + audio combo is unique** — no other model does this natively
- Falls back gracefully if it fails, so it's worth trying
- Still inherits Veo 3's visual quality limitations — not as cinematic as Ray models

### Sora 2 (OpenAI)

#### Overview

OpenAI's video model. Strong at high-energy, multi-subject motion scenes with believable physics and crowd dynamics. Automatic audio generation included.

#### Strengths

- Excellent **multi-subject motion**: crowds, sports, group dynamics, action scenes with multiple moving elements
- Strong **character and world persistence** within a single clip
- Faster than Veo 3.1 (at high-quality)
- Believable **background activity and physics** — things move naturally in the periphery
- **Automatic audio generation** (ambient, SFX, even auto-generated dialogue)

- **Duration options vary by UI and wrapper:**: 4s, 8s, or **15s. Pro users up to 25s**
- **LONGEST duration** of models listed.
- **Sora 2 (base,** $0.10/ second) is cheaper than **Veo 3.1 Fast** $0.15/second).
- Good at **historical recreations** and documentary-style content
- High scene realism and physics accuracy
- Handles complex action better than most other models

#### Weaknesses

- **Only 2 aspect ratios**: 16:9, 9:16: **1792×1024** (landscape) and **1024×1792** (portrait)
- **Only 720p resolution** — 1080p option only for Pro users.
- **No keyframe interpolation** (start frame only, no end frame)
- **Strict content moderation** — no copyrighted material, living celebrities, political figures
- Sora doesn’t guarantee continuity across separate fresh generations; use additional features (Remix/Re-cut/Storyboard), or use **a reference frame**.
- Not ideal for long cinematic storytelling sequences that require shot-to-shot consistency
- **Expensive** in both time and compute resources.
- **Sora 2 Pro high-res ($0.50/sec)** can exceed **Veo 3.1 Standard ($0.40/sec)**.

#### Specialties

High-energy social content, crowd/group dynamics, action scenes with multiple subjects, sports footage, historical recreations, meme-style videos, longer single clips (20s), documentary-style content

#### Best Practices

**General**

- Sora 2 prompting guide says both **shorter prompts** (more creative freedom) and **longer detailed prompts** (more control/consistency) are valid, depending on goals
- Be specific about **shot type, subject, action, setting, and lighting** for best results.
- Sora 2 calls it “briefing a cinematographer.”
- Let the model handle background activity naturally

**Audio**

- For dialogue: 'A woman says, "Welcome home"'
- For SFX: describe explicitly — "waves crash on the shore," "engine revs loudly"
- To suppress audio, OpenAI’s official guide uses **“Diegetic only,” “No score,” “Natural ambience only”**

**Content**

- Can reference **historical figures** (Lincoln, MLK, Freddie Mercury) but **NOT living celebrities**
- No copyrighted characters or IP

**Prompt Template**

`[SHOT TYPE/FRAMING] of [SUBJECTS] [ACTION] in [SETTING], (optional: [SECONDARY MOTION / ENV EFFECTS]), [CAMERA MOVEMENT], [LIGHTING/PALETTE]. (optional: Audio: [DIALOGUE / BACKGROUND SOUND])`

#### Prompt Examples

- "Wide handheld street-level shot of four basketball players in a gritty city court during golden hour, fast crossovers and a drive to the rim; camera tracks alongside the ball-handler, slight shake, shallow depth of field. Lighting: warm low sun, long shadows, dust in the air. Background sound: sneakers squeak on asphalt, ball thumps, crowd cheers, and claps."
- "Wide shot transitioning to a medium tracking shot through a busy open-air market in Morocco; vendors gesture and call out while shoppers pass colorful fabric stalls. Camera: steady handheld gimbal feel, slow weave forward at walking pace. Lighting: bright midday sun with patchy shade under awnings; saturated color palette. Background sound: overlapping voices, bargaining calls, footsteps, cloth flapping in the wind. "
- "Wide shot transitioning to a medium tracking shot through a busy open-air market in Morocco; vendors gesture and call out while shoppers pass colorful fabric stalls. Camera: steady handheld gimbal feel, slow weave forward at walking pace. Lighting: bright midday sun with patchy shade under awnings; saturated color palette. Background sound: overlapping voices, bargaining calls, footsteps, cloth flapping in the wind. "

#### Tips & Gotchas

- **Best for short-form social content** with lots of movement and energy
- The **20s option is powerful** but VERY slow — use strategically
- Use as **fallback when Veo or Ray aren't delivering** what you need
- The auto-audio is a nice bonus but **less controllable than Veo's** quoted dialogue
- Excellent for **memes and viral content** where energy matters more than cinematic polish
- Good at **historical/period recreations** if you need figures from the past

### Kling 2.6 (Kuaishou)

#### Overview

#### Best Practices

**Audio/Dialogue**

- Put dialogue in **quotes for lip-sync**: 'Character says "Hello!"'
- Describe sounds explicitly: "coffee shop chatter, espresso machine hissing"

**CFG Scale**

- Use **CFG scale to control** how strictly the model follows your prompt
- **0.5 = balanced default** (recommended starting point)
- **Higher values** (0.7-1.0) = stricter adherence to prompt
- **Lower values** (0.2-0.4) = more creative freedom

**General**

- Clean concise prompts work best
- Be specific about action and setting

**Prompt Template**

`[SETTING + LIGHTING]. [SUBJECT] [ACTION/MOTION] (optional: [CAMERA]). Audio: [AMBIENCE + SFX]. [CHARACTER] says "[DIALOGUE]" (optional: [VOICE TRAITS]). Style: [VISUAL AESTHETIC].`

#### Prompt Examples

- “Medium close-up, creator facing camera in a home studio, subtle hand gestures, gentle camera push-in. Audio: low-volume lo-fi beat under clear voice, faint room tone. She says, “I’ll show you three AI tricks you can use today.” Warm key light, soft background bokeh, natural skin texture.”
- Nighttime neon street after rain, slow tracking shot from behind as the subject walks, then turns to camera. Audio: rain on pavement, distant traffic, footsteps. She says, “Okay… this is where it starts.” Moody noir lighting, high contrast, shallow depth of field.
- 360-degree rotating shot of a sleek smartphone on a minimal pedestal, slow floating motion. Audio: soft studio room tone, subtle whoosh as it rotates, tiny click as the screen lights. No dialogue. Crisp commercial lighting, clean reflections, product photography look.

#### Tips & Gotchas

- **CFG scale** is useful for fine-tuning adherence vs. creativity
- **Add weight to key elements** by using emphasis indicators (++) for critical elements

**Example:** "++sleek red convertible++ driving along coastal highway"

- **Lip-sync quality is still a standout feature** compared to other models
- **Square (1:1) aspect ratio** option is excellent for Instagram feed posts
- If you need **wider framing or more cinematic work**, use Ray models instead
- Works well for **influencer-style content** with direct-to-camera dialogue
- **Bilingual capability** is useful for international campaigns

### Ray3 & Ray3.14 Video Modify (V2V)

#### Overview

Transform existing videos with prompt-guided frame and/or video modifications. This is video-to-video transformation, not generation from scratch.

#### What It Does

Takes an existing video and modifies it based on your prompt — can change style, lighting, environment, weather, time of day, and more while preserving the underlying motion and composition.

#### Strength Control

Three modes with three intensity levels each:

- **Adhere (1-3)**: Preserves original video closely, subtle changes
- Level 1: Minimal changes
- Level 3: Moderate changes while staying faithful
- **Flex (1-3)**: Balanced transformation
- Level 1: Moderate changes
- Level 3: Significant changes
- **Reimagine (1-3)**: Creative freedom, major transformations
- Level 1: Significant changes
- Level 3: Dramatic reinterpretation

#### Keyframe Support

- Can use **start and/or end frame keyframes** to guide the modification
- Helps maintain specific visual elements or compositions
- Useful for ensuring the output matches a desired aesthetic

#### Best Practices

**CRITICAL RULES**

- Describe **desired END STATE**, not commands
- **NO temporal language** — don't say "changes to" or "transforms into"
- **POSITIVE descriptions only** — say "clear blue sky" NOT "no clouds"
- Be specific about the transformation you want

**Good Examples**

- "Cyberpunk neon city at night, rain-slicked streets, purple and blue lighting"
- "Watercolor painting style, soft pastel colors, impressionistic"
- "Golden hour lighting, warm orange glow, long shadows"

**Bad Examples**

- ❌ "Change the sky to blue" (command, not description)
- ❌ "Remove the clouds" (negative description)
- ❌ "The scene transforms into a forest" (temporal language)

#### Use Cases

- **Style transfer**: Turn live-action into animation, or realistic into illustrated
- **Re-lighting**: Change time of day, add dramatic lighting
- **Environment changes**: Urban to nature, summer to winter, day to night
- **Weather modifications**: Add rain, fog, snow, sunshine
- **Artistic stylization**: Oil painting, watercolor, comic book, cinematic grading

#### Tips & Gotchas

- Start with **lower strength levels** (Adhere 1-2, Flex 1) and increase if needed
- **Higher strength = more deviation** from original — can lose important details
- Works best when the original video has **good motion and composition** already
- Use keyframes to **anchor specific visual elements** you want to preserve
- Great for **repurposing existing footage** into different styles or moods
- Can be used iteratively — modify a video, then modify the result again

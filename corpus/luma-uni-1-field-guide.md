Uni-1 is not about writing the perfect prompt.

It’s about:

**Start → Direct → Refine → Finish**

You can prompt with:

- short text
- long detailed prompts
- structured formats (JSON)
- reference images
- sketches / layouts

## 1. The “Fast Start” Prompt (best for 80% of use cases)

### Template

`A [subject], in [style], with [lighting], [camera/composition], [environment/background], mood: [emotion], details: [key specifics]`

### Example

`A ceramic artist shaping a lopsided bowl, documentary photography style, soft window lighting, close-up shot, cluttered home studio background, mood: focused and quiet, details: clay-covered hands, imperfect texture, tools scattered on wooden table`

### When to use

- Exploration
- First ideas
- Quick outputs

## 2. The “Cinematic Control” Prompt

### Template

`Subject: [who/what]

Style: [editorial / documentary / fine art / etc.]

Scene:
- Environment: [where]
- Time of day: [lighting context]
- Mood: [emotional tone]

Camera:
- Shot type: [close-up / wide / overhead]
- Lens: [35mm / 85mm / etc.]
- Composition: [framing approach]

Details:
- Textures: [materials]
- Motion: [if any]
- Extra: [small details that matter]`

### Example

`Subject: A street tailor repairing a jacket

Style: documentary photography

Scene:
- Environment: sidewalk workshop with hanging fabrics
- Time of day: late afternoon natural light
- Mood: patient, intimate

Camera:
- Shot type: medium close-up
- Lens: 50mm
- Composition: slightly off-center, hands in focus

Details:
- Textures: worn fabric, frayed edges, thread spools
- Motion: subtle hand movement mid-stitch
- Extra: pins in mouth, chalk markings on fabric`

### When to use

- Editorial visuals
- Story-driven imagery
- High-quality outputs

## 3. The “Direct Edit” Prompt

### Template

`Edit instructions:
- Change: [what to modify]
- Keep: [what must stay the same]
- Style shift: [optional]
- Lighting: [optional]
- Details: [specific adjustments]`

### Example

`Edit instructions:
- Change: replace background with a quiet bookstore interior
- Keep: subject posture, clothing, and facial expression
- Style shift: slightly more warm and nostalgic
- Lighting: soft golden indoor lighting
- Details: add bookshelves with uneven stacks and handwritten notes`

### Pro tip

Always define what to **keep** (this prevents drift)

## 4. The “Multi-Reference Fusion” Prompt

### Template

`Combine the following:

IMAGE 1: [what it provides]
IMAGE 2: [what it provides]
IMAGE 3: [optional]

Output:
- Subject: [final image goal]
- Style: [dominant style]
- Composition: [layout guidance]
- Details: [specific merges]`

### Example

`Combine the following:

IMAGE 1: a vintage portrait (use for pose and framing)
IMAGE 2: a modern fashion editorial (use for styling and lighting)
IMAGE 3: textured paper background (use for surface quality)

Output:
- Subject: a contemporary portrait with vintage posture
- Style: editorial with subtle retro influence
- Composition: centered subject, clean framing
- Details: blend modern clothing with aged texture finish`

### When to use

- Style blending
- Character consistency
- Editorial work

## 5. The “Layout Control” Prompt

### Template

`Layout instructions:

[LEFT]: [object + description]
[CENTER]: [object + description]
[RIGHT]: [object + description]
[BACKGROUND]: [environment]

Style: [style]
Lighting: [lighting]`

### Example

`Layout instructions:

LEFT: a stack of handwritten letters tied with string
CENTER: a wooden desk with an open notebook
RIGHT: a cup of tea with steam rising
BACKGROUND: softly lit room with a window

Style: still life photography
Lighting: soft morning natural light`

### Pro tip

Treat this like directing a photoshoot

## 6. The “Storyboard Generator”

### Template

`Create a storyboard with [X] frames.

Story:
[short narrative]

Frame details:
1. [scene]
2. [scene]
3. [scene]

Style: [style]
Consistency: same characters and setting`

### Example

`Create a storyboard with 4 frames.

Story:
A baker wakes up early to prepare bread for the day.

Frame details:
1. Dim kitchen, flour being poured
2. Hands kneading dough on wooden surface
3. Oven light glowing with rising bread
4. Morning customers entering small bakery

Style: warm, documentary realism
Consistency: same space and character throughout`

## 7. The “Loose / Creative Mode”

### Template

`[vibes, fragments, ideas, emotions]`

### Example

`quiet morning, dust in sunlight, old apartment, slightly messy, books everywhere, slow life, soft textures, calm, lived-in feeling`

### When to use

- Mood exploration
- Unexpected ideas
- Early ideation

## 8. The “Structured JSON” Prompt

### Template

`{
 "subject": "",
 "style": "",
 "environment": "",
 "lighting": "",
 "camera": {
 "shot": "",
 "lens": "",
 "composition": ""
 },
 "details": []
}`

### Example

`{
 "subject": "elderly man repairing a watch",
 "style": "fine art photography",
 "environment": "small workshop filled with tools",
 "lighting": "soft directional window light",
 "camera": {
 "shot": "close-up",
 "lens": "85mm",
 "composition": "tight framing on hands"
 },
 "details": ["tiny screws", "dust particles", "aged skin texture"]
}`

## Core Workflows

## Workflow 1: Idea → Final Image

1. Start with Fast Prompt
2. Generate
3. Refine with direct instructions
4. Reroll
5. Finalize

## Workflow 2: Reference-Driven Creation

1. Add 2–3 references
2. Use fusion prompt
3. Adjust composition
4. Refine

## Workflow 3: Fix & Polish

1. Generate
2. Identify issues
3. Edit specific regions
4. Repeat

## Workflow 4: Precision Composition

1. Generate base
2. Add layout
3. Label clearly
4. Regenerate

## Workflow 5: Exploration → Lock → Iterate

1. Generate variations
2. Pick favorite
3. Lock seed
4. Iterate small changes

## Quick Rules

- Be specific (subject + style + composition)
- Put key instructions early
- Use references for consistency
- Don’t restart — refine
- Use layout for control
- Use editing for precision
- Iterate in small steps

### A helpful reminder

You don’t need a perfect prompt.

You need:

a clear idea + direction + iteration

### Key takeaway

Uni-1 isn’t about prompting better.

It’s about:

**thinking visually, then directing the system**
